# Numerical-Analysis
SciLab codes for the basics methods in the Numerical Analysis field.
The Numerical Analysis field dedicates itself to solve some of the most useful mathematical problems using numerical approximations. 

Whenever we can't have the exact solution for an equation or mathematical problem, when it can be very difficult to reach or, sometimes, even impossible, we can use the Numerical Analysis methods to reach approximate solutions and estimate it's errors, granting that our results will be the most accurate possibles. 

Regarding the role of the user (the person who enters the data) and the accuracy of the data, Ruggiero and Lopes (2000, p. 15, our translation) state that "the input data contains an inherent imprecision, that is, there is no way to prevent it from occurring [errors], since they represent measurements obtained using specific equipment [...]". For the authors, the results obtained depend, in addition to the data collection and the choice of the appropriate numerical method, also on the precision of the data, the way the data is represented in the computer and the numerical operations performed.

This repository was created with the intend of armazenate the codes made using the SciLab software for the avaliations of the Numerical Analysis (DCET0305 Cálculo Numérico, 75 hours) class ministrated by the DSc professor André Nagamine on the 2024.1 semester for the Licenciature in Physics course of the Universidade Estadual do Sudoeste da Bahia (UESB). 

You will find here codes for interpolation, integration, differentiation, solution of linear systems of equations and calculate the zeros of functions. Formaly, these codes will be identificated by their tradicional methods names, as it's learned on the lectures. 

It's expected that you'll find these codes usefull at your Mathematics, Physics or Computer Science studies and works.
