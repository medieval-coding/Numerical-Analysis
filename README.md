# Numerical-Analysis
SciLab codes for the basics methods in the Numerical Analysis field.
The Numerical Analysis field dedicates itself to solve some of the most useful mathematical problems using numerical approximations. 

Whenever we can't have the exact solution for an equation or mathematical problem, when it can be very difficult to reach or, sometimes, even impossible, we can use the Numerical Analysis methods to reach approximate solutions and estimate it's errors, granting that our results will be the most accurate possibles. 

This repository was created with the intend of armazenate the codes made using the SciLab software for the avaliations of the Numerical Analysis (DCET0305 Cálculo Numérico, 75 hours) class ministrated by the DSc professor André Nagamine on the 2024.1 semester for the Licenciature in Physics course of the Universidade Estadual do Sudoeste da Bahia (UESB). 

You will find here codes for interpolation, integration, differentiation, solution of linear systems of equations and calculate the zeros of functions. Formaly, these codes will be identificated by their tradicional methods names, as it's learned on the lectures. 

I hope that you'll find these codes usefull at your Mathematics, Physics or Computer Science studies and works.
